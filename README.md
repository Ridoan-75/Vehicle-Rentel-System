## 📍 The Process

I started this project by setting up a solid backend foundation using Express and TypeScript to keep the code strongly typed, modular, and easy to maintain. After establishing the environment and PostgreSQL integration, I built out the authentication system with JWT and bcrypt to handle secure signup and login for both admin and customer roles. From there, I implemented individual modules for users, vehicles, and bookings each split into routes, controllers, and services for clear separation of concerns. Business rules such as automatic vehicle availability updates, prevention of deletions when active bookings exist, and total price calculations were introduced and refined through continuous testing in Thunder Client. I also added role‑based visibility so that customers can only see and manage their own bookings, while admins can oversee the entire system. Finally, validation, error messaging, and user‑friendly responses (like notifying first‑time customers who have no bookings) were included to make the API polished, reliable, and production‑ready.
